# 🎁 Giveaway Scraper 🎁
This Giveaway Scraper was specially made for people who want easy giveaway wins. It's essentially a Reddit filter, using Java streams for filtering and mapping, and uses the Reddit API and Discord API to get and then display the information.

# 📝 Setup 📝
1. First things first, you'd want to head to the Configuration file. Change the 'token' string to your Discord bot token. **I don't recommend changing the subreddit value**, as the code was specifically designed for it. Change the game filter as you please, aswell as the username block filter.

2. Go to *redditpost/SendPost* and change **ALL** the credentials, aswell as the strings in the UserAgent. If you don't know how, please lookup a guide on how to make a reddit. Click [here](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) to make the reddit application.

3. Assuming you added your Discord bot to your server, all is done. Run the application and the bot is up. It has 2 main commands:
- Search - a command to search for games, this apps main purpose
- Clear - clears all messages in a channel

# 💻 Contributing 💻
Contributing isn't really needed for this project. However, there is a few QOL features that would be pretty nice. Them being:
- A new command to search for specific games. This would be greatly appreciated. 
- A overhaul to the 'Clear' command, as it lacks speed.

I'll put in a quick tutorial here for Git;

1. Make sure that in your terminal your directory is focused on the `giveaway-scraper`

2. Run ```git status```

3. If it runs fine, run ```git add .``` or ```git add <files>``` for specific files

4. Now run ```git commit -m "Message"```

5. Run ```git push origin master``` and it's done.
