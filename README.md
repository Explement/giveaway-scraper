# 🎁 Giveaway Scraper 🎁
 This Giveaway Scraper was specially made for people who want easy giveaway wins. It's essentially a Reddit filter, using Java streams for filtering and mapping, and uses the Reddit API and Discord API to get and then display the information. 
 # 📝 Setup 📝
  1. First things first, you'd want to head to the Configuration file. Change the 'token' string to your Discord bot token. **I don't recommend changing the subreddit value**, as the code was specifically designed for it. Change the game filter as you please, aswell as the username block filter. 
  2. Go to *redditpost/SendPost* and change **ALL** the credentials, aswell as the strings in the UserAgent. If you don't know how, please lookup a guide on how to make a reddit. Click [here](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) to make the reddit application. 
  3. Assuming you added your Discord bot to your server, all is done. Run the application and the bot is up. 
  It has 2 main commands: 
  - **Search** - a command to search for games, this apps main purpose 
  - **Clear** - clears all messages in a channel 
  # 💻 Contributing 💻 
  Contributing isn't really needed for this project. However, there is a few QOL features that would be pretty nice. Them being: 
  - A new command to search for specific games. This would be greatly appreciated. 
  - A overhaul to the 'Clear' command, as it lacks speed. 
  Incase someone wants to contribute, I'll put in a quick tutorial here for Git;
   1. Make sure that in your terminal your directory is focused on the `giveaway-scraper` 
   2. Run ```git status``` 
   3. If it runs fine, run ```git add .``` or ```git add <files>``` for specific files 
   4. Now run ```git commit -m "Message"``` 
   
   5. Run ```git push origin master``` and it's done

   # 📄 License 📄 
   This project has no license as it took me just about a few days to make.

   # 🚀 About  🚀
This project took me 4 days to make, as it was essentially just a revamp of a previous project. This is made to get giveaway links and even post to them without any effort.
